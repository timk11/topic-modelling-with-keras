# topic-modelling-keras
**Topic modelling with Keras, constructed as a capstone project**

This model was originally constructed as a capstone project for the Microsoft Professional Certificate in Artificial Intelligence on EdX. 

The task was to build a machine learning model that would learn to identify topics from a large selection of documents published by the World Health Organisation. A list of topics was provided, and documents could have any number of topics attributed to them. A labelled dataset was provided for model construction and testing, and a separate unlabelled dataset was used for scoring the assignment.

I tested several versions of the model and have reproduced the best version in this repository. The result from this version was in the top 6% of course participant results. Due to possible copyright issues, I haven't included the training and test set files, so the notebook contained here will not run properly, but instead I've included explanations of all the steps.
